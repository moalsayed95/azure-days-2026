    "# 🐍 AI Travel Agent with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Scenario Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an intelligent travel planning agent using the Microsoft Agent Framework for Python. The agent leverages Azure AI Foundry to automatically generate personalized day-trip itineraries for random destinations worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- 🎲 **Smart Destination Selection**: Custom tool function for random destination picking\n",
    "- 🗺️ **Detailed Itinerary Generation**: AI-powered travel planning with local recommendations\n",
    "- 🔄 **Async Processing**: Uses asyncio for efficient API communication\n",
    "- 🛠️ **Tool Integration**: Demonstrates function calling capabilities in AI agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "- **Agent Framework**: Python implementation of Microsoft's agent orchestration system\n",
    "- **Azure AI Foundry**: Access to state-of-the-art language models via Azure OpenAI service\n",
    "- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Uses OpenAI client patterns with Azure AI Foundry backend\n",
    "- **Environment Management**: Secure credential handling with python-dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Flow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "User Request → ChatAgent → Azure AI Foundry API ↔ get_random_destination()\n",
    "                     ↓\n",
    "              Travel Itinerary Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Classes & Methods\n",
    "- `ChatAgent`: Main conversational agent orchestrator\n",
    "- `OpenAIChatClient`: Azure AI Foundry API client wrapper\n",
    "- `get_random_destination()`: Custom tool function for destination selection\n",
    "- Environment variables: Secure API configuration management\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Dependencies:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install agent-framework-core -U\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Configuration (.env file):**\n",
    "```env\n",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/\n",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_ID=gpt-4o-mini\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Foundry Access:**\n",
    "1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal\n",
    "2. Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)\n",
    "3. Get your endpoint and API key from Keys & Endpoint section\n",
    "4. Configure environment variables as shown above\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the cells below in sequence to:\n",
    "1. Import required libraries and load environment variables\n",
    "2. Define the random destination generator tool\n",
    "3. Create and configure the AI agent\n",
    "4. Run travel planning requests and view results\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build an intelligent travel planning assistant! 🌟"
